# SOLID CLI App Sandbox

This is currently a sandbox to experiment with interacting with a Solid POD from outside of the browser.
Solid applications are separated entirely from their users' data.
A consequence of this is that the applications cannot do anything with their users' data when they are not logged into the application.
This project aims to explore how an application can work around this limitation.

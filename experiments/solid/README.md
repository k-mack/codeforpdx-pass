# Solid Experiments

## Prerequisites

*  Node.js >= 12 (<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>)
* NPX
* 2 web browsers that supports private windows (Why 2? So you can log in as two different users without sharing cookies.)

After installing Node.js, install NPX:

```bash
# Open terminal, and run:
npm install -g npx
```

## Experiments

The following experiments exist:

* 01-one-server: Alice and Bob use Oregon's single server that provides a WebID, Solid Pod, and a data browser application to share a picture.
* 02-different-file-browser-application: Alice likes her Pod, but not the state-provided file browser, so she tries a different one.
